## Hallgren 2013

The article you read prior to the session contains accompanying R scripts and CSV data files which you can peruse in the [Hallgren2013](./Hallgren2013) folder of this repository. It contains:  

Annotated R syntax file for Example 1: "novel question.R"  
Annotated R syntax file for Example 2: "power analysis.R"  
Annotated R syntax file for Example 3: "bootstrapping.R"  

CSV dataset generated in Example 1, which is also used later in Example 2: "novel_question_output.csv"  
CSV dataset used in Example 3: "mediation_raw_data.csv"
