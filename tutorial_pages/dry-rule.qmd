# **D**o not **R**epeat **Y**ourself - DRY rule

## *vs.* **W**rite **E**verything **T**wice - WET rule

<br/>
Following the WET rule will:  

* Increase the difficulty of change  
* Decrease clarity  
* Leads to opportunities for inconsistency  
<br/>
To prevent duplication and follow the DRY rule, we can write custom functions.  

Functions are 'self contained' sets of commands that accomplish a specific task.   
Functions usually 'take in' data or parameter values (these inputs are called 'function arguments'), process it, and 'return' a result. 
You've already used several functions in this tutorial; for example `rnorm(n, mean, sd)`, where `n`, `mean`, and `sd` are inputs and the result is a random sample from the normal distribution. 
The only difference here is that you are writing the function yourself. 
Once a function is written, it can be used over and over again by calling its name, just like other functions such as `rnorm()`.  
To write your own function, use the function `function`:

* `AwesomeFunctionName <- function(argument1, argument2,â€¦){  
do stuff here  
}`

To build up a function, start by writing the "`stuff`" to test that it works outside the function.

***

**YOUR TURN:**  
Create a function that draws a histogram of `nrep` mean(rnorm(100))  
Modify your function to draw a histogram of `nrep` mean(rnorm(`n`))


***

Note that it is useful to define `nrep` outside of the function, so users of your script can more easily change that value e.g. from a low number (to verify the script runs without error) to a large number (to obtain reliable results).
