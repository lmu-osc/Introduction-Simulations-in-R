# Using simulations to check alpha

In most quantitative sciences we accept a type 1 error rate of "0.05", which is often called the `alpha` or significance level. This value tells us the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e. of finding an effect) given that the null hypothesis is true. 

In other words, if there is no true effect (e.g. no difference between two groups), we would expect our null hypothesis of no effect to be rejected (incorrectly), `alpha`% of the time.

If you draw from the same normal distribution twice, will the mean of the two samples differ significantly in 5% of the cases?

**YOUR TURN:**  
Figure out how to do a t-test in R  
Generate two vectors of 10 values drawn from N(0,1) and compare them with a t-test  
Figure out how to extract the p-value from that object (explore your R object with the functions `str` or `names`)    
Write a function simT that generates two vectors of `n` values drawn from a N(0,1), compare them with a t-test and return the p-value  
Repeat with `nrep`=20 and draw a histogram for `n`=10  
Repeat with `nrep`=100 and draw a histogram for `n`=10

In the first case, where `nrep` = 20, we expect 1 out of the 20 tests to be significant (5%). In my case, I did! How many did you get?    
In the second case, where `nrep` = 100, we expect 5 out of the 100 tests to be significant. In my case, I got 6. How many did you get?      
Are those deviations meaningful? Significant?

**YOUR TURN:**  
Plot the output of the function simT with `nrep`=1000 and `n`=10  
Plot the output of the function simT with `nrep`=1000 and `n`=100

In both cases, we expect 50 out of the 1000 tests to be significant by chance (i.e. with a p value under 0.05). In my simulations, I get 40 and 45 false positive results, for `n`=10 and 100, respectively. How many did you get?  

These proportions are not signicantly different from 5%. 

`prop.test(45, 1000, p = 0.05, alternative = "two.sided", correct = TRUE)`  
1-sample proportions test with continuity correction  
data:  45 out of 1000, null probability 0.05  
X-squared = 0.42632, df = 1, p-value = 0.5138  

It is important to note that, although `alpha = 0.05` is commonly used, this is an arbitrary choice and you should consider what is an appropriate type 1 error rate for your particular investigation.  

Altough it isn't necessary to check that a statistical analysis as simple as a t-test does not yield more than 5% of false-positive results, when the structure of the data is complex and analysed with more advanced models (e.g. when explanatory variables are mathematically linked to each other, and are combined in a mixed-effect models), this may allow to compare different modelling approach and select the one that does not produce more than 5% false positive results.  

Such complex example where simulations is the only viable approach to construct a statistical model that does not lead to spurious effects can be found in this paper:
