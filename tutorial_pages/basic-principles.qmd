# Basic principles

Basically, a simulation consists of:  
**1) Generating `n` random numbers from a known distribution.**    
**2) Repeating this `nrep` times.**  

Once you know how to do this, the questions we will explore are:   
**1) What sample size `n` should we use within a simulation?**  
**2) How many simulation repetitions `nrep` should we run?**
