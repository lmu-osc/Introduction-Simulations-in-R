# Limitations to simulations

1. **Assumptions** made regarding variables might not be true, e.g. the distribution of supposedly normally distributed data may not be quite normal. (Have a back-up analysis plan!)  

2. **Parameter space may be unknown**. (Explore it a bit and use previous observations to be at least in a relevant range.)  

3. **Computational resources and time**. (Use research software engineer staff on campus to optimize code, use parallel core processing, use server services on campus, etc.)  

4. **Simulations might be redundant with mathematical demonstrations**. (I don't mind, still useful for me!)
