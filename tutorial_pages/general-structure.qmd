# General structure of a simulation

1. **define** what type of data and variables need to be simulated, i.e. their **distribution**, their class (e.g. factor vs numerical value), **sample sizes** (within a dataset, and number of replicates), what will need to vary (e.g. the strength of relationship)  

2. **generate data**, random data or data including an effect (e.g. an imposed correlation between two variables)  

3. **run the statistical test** you think is appropriate, and record the relevant statistic (e.g. p-value) 

4. **replicate** step 2 and 3 to get the distribution of the statistic of interest  

5. try out different parameter sets (**explore the parameter space** for which results are similar)  

6. **analyze and interpret the combined results of many simulations** within each set of parameters. For instance, check that you only get a significant result in 5% of the simulations (if `alpha = 0.05`) when you simulated no effect; and that you get at a significant result in 80% of the simulations (if you targeted a `power` of 80%) when you simulated an effect
