# Limitations to simulations
<br/>

1. **assumptions** made regarding variables might not be true, e.g. the distribution of supposedly normally distributed data may not be quite normal (have back-up plan)  

2. **parameter space unknown** (explore it a bit, use previous observations to be at least in a relevant range)  

3. **computational power and time** (use research software engineer staff on campus to optimize code, use parallel core processing, use server services on campus, ect)  

4. **simulations might be redundant with mathematical demonstrations** (I don’t mind, still useful for me)
