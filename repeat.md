# Repetition

The function  
* `replicate(nrep, expression)` repeats the `expression` provided `nrep` times.

  * e.g. `replicate(10, mean(rnorm(100)))` reads: 'draw 100 values from a normal distribution with a mean 0 and sd 1, caclulate the mean of these 100 values, and do all that 10 times.'
  
***

**YOUR TURN:**  
In your local exercice script:  
Replicate 1000 times the mean of 10 values drawn from a unifrom distribution between 0 and 10.  
Replicate 100 times the mean of 50 values drawn from a normal distribution of mean 10 and standard deviation 5.  
Make a histogram of each of your results, are the distributions looking as expected?
