# Introduction to Simulations in R

## About this work
This work is based on materials from [Joel Pick](https://joelpick.wixsite.com/research), [Hadley Wickham](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/19077330/simulation-hadley-wickham), [Kevin Hallgren](https://doi.org/10.20982/tqmp.09.2.p043), and [myself](https://github.com/MalikaIhle/simulation_course).

## Prior to the session
1) Fork and clone this repository ([here](https://github.com/MalikaIhle/Collaborative-RStudio-GitHub) is a reminder on how to fork and clone and what it means)  

2) Read [Hallgren A. K. 2013. Conducting simulation studies in the R programming environment. Tutor Quant Methods Psychol. ; 9(2): 43–60.](https://doi.org/10.20982/tqmp.09.2.p043) and answer the following 3 questions in your local copy of the [reading sheet](./Hallgren2013/ReadingSheet.md):  
  * describe 6 steps common to all simulations  
  * describe 3 types of simulations use  
  * describe 4 limitations of simulations

## Self-paced workshop
The workshop will alternate presentation of concepts and simple exercices for you to try to apply them in R. Each time you see written **YOUR TURN**, switch to your local copy of the [exercice script](./exercice_script.R), review the examples if needed, complete the exercice, and check out the proposed answer (which often contain additional tips).  
It is necessary that you work through the sections in order. Please read the blurbs of each sections below to get an overview of what is coming before starting.    

* [Definition](./definition.md) - what are simulations?
* [Purpose](./purpose.md) - what can we use simulations for?
* [Basic Principles](./basic-principles.md) - what do we need to create a simulation?
* [Random Number Generators](./random-numbers-generators.md) - how to generate random numbers in R?
* [Repeat](./repeat.md) - how to repeat the generation of random numbers multiple times?
* [Setting the seed](./seed.md) - how can you generate the same random numbers?
* [Sample size `n`](./sample-size-n.md) - how many values should you generate within a simulation?
* [Sample size `nrep`](./sample-size-nrep.md) - how many repeats of simulations should you run?
* [Dry rule](./dry-rule.md) - how to write your own functions?
* [Simulate](./simulate.md) - write your first simulation!
* [General structure](./general-structure.md) - what is the general structure of a simulation?
* [Limitations](./limitations.md) - what are the limitations to simulations?
* [More advanced simulations](./advanced-simulations.md) - what are real life examples of simulations?
